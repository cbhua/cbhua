### Hi there! I am Chuanbo. 

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) with the project of InnoCore PRISM-AI. I'm doing research with my colleagues in [SILab](http://silab.kaist.ac.kr) and Prof. [Jinkyoo Park](https://pure.kaist.ac.kr/en/persons/jinkyoo-park). I am also working with great peers at the [AI4CO](https://github.com/ai4co) open source group and the [DiffEqML](https://github.com/DiffEqML) open source group.

You may find additional info on my [homepage](https://cbhua.github.io).
