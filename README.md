### Hi! Here is Chuanbo. 

I just graduated as a Ph.D. from the **Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)**. I'm doing research with my colleagues at the *Systems Intelligence Laboratory* (SILab) suprevised by Prof. Jinkyoo Park. I am also working with great peers at the [AI4CO](https://github.com/ai4co) open source group and the [DiffEqML](https://github.com/DiffEqML) open source group.

You may find additional info on my [homepage](https://cbhua.github.io).
